Before any machine learning is done, visualizing the data can reveal a lot of patterns. Exploring them can pay huge dividends later, as we can get a good intuition about what algorithm to use, which features to omit, etc.\n",

The distribution seems to be stretched out across both variables, although the shape suggests that the data can be simplified from a particular viewpoint. The features seem correlated: if $ x_1 $ is small, then $ x_2 $ is large. If $ x_1 $ is large, $ x_2 $ is small. This means that the variables contain redundant information. Redundancy is suboptimal when we have hundreds of features.

    "When multiplying the vector $ v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} $ and a matrix $ X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n} $ together, $ vX \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times n} $ contains the inner products of $ v $ with every column of the matrix $ X $.\n",

    "Based purely on the general definition, it is hard to get an insight into what an inner product does. However, by using the concept of orthogonality, we can visualize what does $ \\langle x, y \\rangle $ represent for any $ x $ and $ y $.\n",

    "How can we find $ x_p $ and $ x_o $? Since $ x_p $ has the same direction as $ y $, it can be written in the form $ x_p = c y $ for some $ c $. Because the two vectors sum up to $ x $, we also have $ x_o = x - x_p = x - c y $. Since this is orthogonal to $ y $, the constant $ c $ can be determined by solving the equation\n",
