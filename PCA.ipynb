    "The ability to look at the data with your eyes is one of the most under-appreciated things in machine learning. Before any machine learning is done, visualizing the data can reveal a lot of patterns. Exploring them can pay huge dividends later, as we can get a good intuition about what algorithm to use, which features to omit, etc.\n",

    "However, there is a big issue: humans cannot see in dimensions larger than three. So, for real-life datasets, we have to perform certain tricks to benefit from the insight that visualization can provide. \n",

    "\n",
    "What we can observe right away is that the features $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ are perhaps not the best descriptors of our data. The distribution seems to be stretched out across both variables, although the shape suggests that the data can be simplified from a particular viewpoint. The features seem correlated: if $ x_1 $ is small, then $ x_2 $ is large. If $ x_1 $ is large, $ x_2 $ is small. This means that the variables contain redundant information. Redundancy is suboptimal when we have hundreds of features. If we could reshape the data to a form where the variables are uncorrelated and ordered according to importance, we would be able to discard those that are not that expressive.\n",
